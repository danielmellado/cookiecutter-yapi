Development
-----------

Better work on a virtual environment

Create a directory called ``instance`` with a file ``config.py``.
This file will host the sensible information:

``instance/config.py``

.. code-block:: python

    SECRET_KEY = 'this_secret_is_not_secret'


Now install the application with pip and run development server:

.. code-block:: bash

    # pip install --editable .

    # . activate_dev.sh

Creates the database and run development server:

.. code-block:: bash

    # flask db init
    # flask db migrate
    # flask db upgrade

    # flask run

For testing:

.. code-block:: bash

    # python setup.py test

The project includes the following routes for test:

GET /
GET /foo
GET /pdn

Resource REST API:

GET /pdn/<int:i>
POST /pdn
PUT /pdn/<int:i>
DELETE /pdn/<int:i>

PDN is a resource with the following attributes:


    {
        "id": 1,
        "codigo": "Xu7yy5-4",
        "descripcion": "Una cosa que se llama pdn",
        "ip_master": "10.10.10.10"
    }

The API is documented following swagger specification.

Building
--------

python setup.py bdist_wheel

A wheel package is created in ``dist`` directory which can be deployed
in a virtualenv (or whatever) with ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install package-name.whl

now it has to be setted the enviroments variables:

.. code-block:: bash

   FLASK_APP=api_scgc
   APP_CONFIG_FILE=/path/to/config/file
