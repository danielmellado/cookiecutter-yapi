Development
-----------

Better work on a virtual environment.

Install the application with pip and run development server:

.. code-block:: bash

    # pip install --editable .

    # . activate_dev.sh

Creates the database and run development server:

.. code-block:: bash

    # flask db init
    # flask db migrate
    # flask db upgrade

    # flask run

For testing:

.. code-block:: bash

    # python setup.py test

The application is configurated in file pdn_api_scgc/config.py, but these values can be overwritten by creating a python
file and adding its path to the environment variable APP_CONFIG_FILE. This will be useful when deploying the application.

The project includes the following routes for test:

GET /
GET /foo
GET /pdn

Resource REST API:

GET /pdn/<int:i>
POST /pdn
PUT /pdn/<int:i>
DELETE /pdn/<int:i>

PDN is a resource with the following attributes:


    {
        "id": 1,
        "codigo": "Xu7yy5-4",
        "descripcion": "Una cosa que se llama pdn",
        "ip_master": "10.10.10.10"
    }

The API is documented following swagger specification.
